#### Why Yet Another Boilerplate?
Create React App is the the new blessed way of creating a React SPA project infrastructure. However (by design decision) it does not include many of the tools required to build a Single Page Application. This simple boilerplate was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and adds on the top of that the bare minimum libraries & tools required to create a SPA.

In details, on the top of CRA, it adds:
 - sass
 - redux & redux-thunk
 - react-router
 - an eslint configuration
 - a travis integration
 - a [React Storybook](https://getstorybook.io/docs) basic configuration

The filesystem structure follows the [redux ducks proposal](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux).
